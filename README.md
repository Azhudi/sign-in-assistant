# Sign-in-assistant

Sign-in-assistant - a Python package that will give you random registration data (such as your nickname, email address, and password). Fake data can be used to register on various services, fill in a test database, anonymize data, and so on.

Creates a random euphonious nickname by merging vowel and consonant letters.
Issues random email and a response to it based on the site api "post-shift.ru".
Generates a random password from these characters.

P. S. Do not judge strictly for mistakes, I am still a novice and not familiar with the language.
